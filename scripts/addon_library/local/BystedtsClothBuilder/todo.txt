NOTES:
scene unit scale does not seem to affect simulation at all

TODO:
    Self collision

    Off/on simulation & collision on specific objects

    pinning group is not added!!!

    Make sure collision is after cloth modifier

    activate/deactivate cloth and collision

    use event when changing sim quality to change all cloth sims

    transforms_to_deltas_on_pin_objects funkar inte. Jag har gjort en TEST operator

    Reset pins when apply base

    Issues when removing pins on multiple objects

    Allow adding cloth sim when locators are selected

    Don't reset end frame for simulation when stopping. User needs to get the final shape of cloth. 
    Make sure simulation/cache on cloth modifier gets same scene final frame when starting simulation  

    Don't display pins in UI when mode is not edit mode

    Prop for collision distance. Needs to apply to collision modifiers as well. 
    Make this global per scene. Operator for guessing based on size?

    Apply base and bake subdiv and multires mods
    Make properties for this
    If prop is off, turn off modifiers before applying shape    

    Apply base should work with multires. Just apply
    cloth modifier and add a copy with its setting

    Add pin does not work

    reset pins should work when pins are selected 
    (need to solve context override in edit mode. Check blender chat #python 230604)

    make get override function for object vs edit mode

    set modifier settings when adding a new modifier 
    (collision or cloth) so it gets correct settings

    set modifier settings before running simulation 
    (since default values of props might not have been changed)

fix all functions that had override issues (still issue with reset_hook_modifiers )

    shrink & expand for pillows etc
    use pressure, shrinking factor

    Option for triangulate modifier after cloth for
    fixing wrinkles. Use longest diagonal


    remove pin should not be availiable unless 
    a pin is selected

    reshape multires modifier (separate button?)

    Use global settings or not (boolean options in UI)

    fit selected to active (fit pants etc with shrink modifier)
    
    Make pillow example


    collision distanse should be 0.005 per default

    keep normals on all triangulate modifiers

    restore also scale and rotation on pins when resetting simulation

    add pin puts cloth mod at wrong place

    override normals when adding a collider

    test apply base with subdiv on + geo nodes.
    I think the cloth mod ends up in wrong place

    Pre made clothes with seams. Use asset browser  

    Document all operators

    bug when removing pins when hook modifier has no object

    Asset browser is still weird the first time you open it
    The problem might be that the asset library is not loaded 
    into blender the first time

    global collision quality

    Add default vertex groups when adding a new cloth modifier

    Fill pressure with weight

    Add props for controlling shrinkage etc

    turn off specific geo nodes when painting wheights?

    subdivide in geo nodes (post uv etc)

    uv map in geo nodes

save as shapekey bakes subdivision modifier

show asset browser crashes blender after reload scripts

Remove test operator before releasing addon

Set up low res collision object (join geo nodes, remesh and decimate)

Geo nodes for making holes/tears

Geo node for outputting multiple vtx groups to
pinning group?

change subdivision in ui. 
Then always go to frame 1
I could also recalculate bending etc to keep the behaviour of the cloth

make popup for cloth modifier

Append pre made cloth brushes from file
Wait until brushes are supported as assets
