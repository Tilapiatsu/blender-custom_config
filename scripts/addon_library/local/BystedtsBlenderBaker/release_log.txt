Bystedts Blender Baker 1.0.1
2021-09-03
--------------------------------------------------
Features:

Smart renaming of bake passes names when changing bake_type
--------------------------------------------------
Bugs:

Fixed 

Removing a bake collection with object that does not belong to 
another collection removes object from blender file

Fixed issue where Blender freezes if bake objects are in a collection
that is excluded in the view layer

Fixed crash at delete scene that seems to be related to deleting
scenes while a function is running in a timer

Fixed issue with baking combined pass

Added check to only set outside pointing normals to objects that has 
inverted scaling. Otherwise planes can get inverted normals.

Baking lowres gives washed out texture results when user has other than "None"
in bpy.context.scene.view_settings.look in default settings
