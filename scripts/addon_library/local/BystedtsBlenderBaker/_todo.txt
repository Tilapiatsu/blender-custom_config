about UI refresh during a running function for progress bar etc
https://devtalk.blender.org/t/question-about-ui-lock-ups-when-running-a-python-script/6406/8

To debug:
bpy.app.debug_wm = True while Blender is running.

To message user
self.report({'INFO'}, 'Message')

To do:
    I finally got reloading modules to work. Backup the files. 
    Link objects to current scene and remove after
    Get the UI to work. 
    write bake manager - snatch from bake to vertex color
    write bake script and also write object_manager
    test code for baking - likely some bugs
    add property for folder location for baked images. 
    handle sRGB or non color på images
    IT DOES NOT WORK TO BAKE MULTIPLE OBJECTS. IMAGE IS OVERWRITTEN
    UV layout per collection
    implement object space or world space for baking 
    auto calculate extrude (cage size)

    UI for manually linking high res objects 
    add high res objects to your current scene


    figure out margin from resolution when packing UV - nope. Packing at 0.005-0.01 should do it


    implement baking in temporary scene to avoid heavy load times

    check that object has high res objects before baking so it does not fail

    reset rotation when baking

    clear_images needs to be finished in bake_manager 

    resolution is not taken into account if image already exists

    dynamic UI for bake passes

    Clean up UI

    when baking - turn off build modifiers

    select objects with no bake objects

    add bakeset object to selected based on bounding box

    Bake in temporary scene if needed for clean AO bakes etc

    better settings for margin - it's always 16
    
    object info panel
    Selected objects (count)
    High poly objects (count and list)

    bake per pass

    some weirdness when baking AO and denoising and reloading image
The error seems to come from that the image is not saved properly
to begin with

clean up create_compositing_tree in composit_manager.py
make sure it works to render and stuff. 
I should be able to run denoise separately

better name than 'bake_image_'. Fix this with global settings?

create channel shuffle image via button

! tighten up bake pass ui

delete button like [x] in top right corner of bake pass

Currently the "delete all bake images" uses names to check if an images
should be deleted

bug: big res images does not rescale at rebake

UI in top needs to be reshuffled. Some props are actually global and some are not

subsample to general setting

Button that bakes from self (i.e. not high res)

remove global settings

Need to change padding when baking

add filter so only mesh objects are included in bake

BUG: bakes all passes when baking just one pass with button.
The code thinks that bake_passes == NOne

time report for baking? really good for debugging

when baking, the target image node just keeps being added and added in the material

fix bug with baking ambient occlusion
denoise works when image already exist it seems

fix bug when using denoise

Bake metallic

Bake collection
Add property on collection to say it's bake collection.   - OK!
This should fix issue when an object belong to multiple collections
Check if object is in bake collection or if parent collection is bake
collection

add icon to all buttons

WHen baking in current scene - make sure high res objects and
their collections are visible during baking

show latest report

improve high res object matching

original position prop on hi res does not seem to be deleted

clean up code sort of. Rename game prop stuff and the addon itself

Continue to merge the bake_image_per_pass. from row 600
I need to sort of merge bake_objects and bake_image_per_pass somehow
check that explode or use Current location makes a difference in code!!!!

how do I handle baking when multiple objects are selected and they belong
to separate bake collections?

rename that ui option above to object position or so

rename the module high_res_objects to high_res_objects_manager 

have written code for exploding
write for resetting high res object positions
implement exploding in bake step

when baking ao for example>
Baking in same scene, the original low res objects needs to be hidden

clean up code . CURRENT_LOCATION and reset_positions and stuff like that should 
be renamed to "location" instead of "position"

stored high res objects should probably move to window manager

Issues when trying to write to a folder. Relative does not work very well.

possibly combine objects when baking to save time?
Yes! Test when baking normal:
combined low res = 4.5 seconds
one bake per object = 33 seconds
Strange. New tests resulted in slower bakes when objects was merged
combined 2k normal baked = 28 s
separate objects 2k normal baked = 59 s

report - change to average baking time per object and channel/image

Explode objects with possibility to keep positions
Exclude moving in specific axis to avoid mirror issues
bättre default på extrude

Bake knapp bredvid bake collection

some sort of nosy compression issue at each save. Det var dither.ush!

auto update preview materials after all bakes are completed

filter high res objects in UI list

progress bar
https://blog.michelanders.nl/2017/04/how-to-add-progress-indicator-to-the-info-header-in-blender.html

Bake with message

clean code -  
bpy.context > context
Done until object_manager

clean up not needed baking functions

separate bake collection to own panel

guided ui?

add error message when there are no objects in the bake collection

add baking workflow to baking report

currently refactoring bake_texture
refactor main baking functions

    remove all high poly from selected at the bottom (gustavs comment)

replace item_callback with items for EnumProperty

when adding high res object with picker - only add bakable objects

can't create bake collection when in local view

check all popups for buttons

fixa ful popup när man assigner by bounding box

RENDER_PT_bbb_image_format
Add file format settings at the bottom:
compression
color depth 
tiff_codec
color depth
make tif with lzw as default? Check file sizes

hide explosion options when baking low res

open collection folder. Select collection objects

test bake with all file formats. TGA is called TARGA in code etc

normal map option for open gl or direct x

never use explode when baking workflow is low poly only
position based shading can get really bad, right?
I guess ao would be the exception. Setting for explode? Auto etc

add error catches. 
-objects does not have connected highpoly (when baking against highpoly) - now has warning
- Objects are hidden, - works ok
- non selectable etc - work ok

- info regarding non support for mix shaders if base color or metallic

Add functionality for non square textures

only open folder (bake collection) if folder exists

delete bake image after completion

displacement pass

nåt strul med set settings när displacement bakas i current scene

set name of collections

fix class poll for bake when selection is required.


when creating bake collections - link objects and don't move them from 
other collections

there is some error when baking...

error when baking selected.

stuck when baking with empty bake collection

test that harden edges does not use modifiers

Auto genegenerate cage to avoid ugly hard normals

it's enough to activate cage in settings. I don't need to actually create it.
Disable it for now and rename option "cage"

cage is always on for some reason

do more tests to see if cubes can bake with hard edges, smooth, auto smooth etc

add anti aliasing in comp

hide original objects during baking in order to get correct AO etc

Bakes only one pass

resize image does not work. It seems I need to set up a context.area.
Perhaps already in bake_specific_pass. Otherwise in resize_image
I should test an earlier version of the addon and see if it works.
What has broken etc? Removing all bake images solved the issue

create_compositing_tree - make this use a setup list so that 
multiple setups can be done in one go. Channel transfer might need 
to be treated separately
when baking selected, it does not comp correctly with existing image


new channel shuffle solution here
i.e. check properties of earlier operators
https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/65786/python-putting-operator-in-another-operator-draw

expose channel source in channel transfer pass

make sure channel transfer bake passes is processed last!! (done)

finish writing do_channel_transfer

denoising should happen on bake image!!!
post_baking_compositing
There should be one single comp tree instead of one save per each thing

create_channel_transfer_image might not be needed later

is channel transfer image linear?? - YES

remove the old channel transfer

compositor still fucks up image when rendering just one object

Channel shuffle has issues. Since I render new images, the index does
not represent the correct image. I should do the transfer as a separate
pass with channel source images and target image as some type of other list.
perhaps custom UI again.

check what happens when baking and no source Is
set in channel transfer bake pass
The image is completely black, which is fine

after baking, the high res collection is visible, even 
though it's hidden at the start

do_channel_transfer should have its own bake render settings

do_channel_transfer produces junk images in blender


bake and do_channel_transfer produces junk bake image in folder
create_bake_image_if_missing saves it to disk directly. 
is that really needed????

when deleting bake images, the actual files are not deleted.
should they be in the code??
use this
bpy.path.native_pathsep(path)

on channel transfer - use boolean option for override image with name
instead of another string

in bake_texture it seems that bake_render_settings
is already storing a lot of object and collection
visibility settings. Can I remove some code??


is area used in bake_texture???? No - removed

testa om namngivning av filer fungerar. Skippa vissa alternativ
annars

Remove duplicated low poly objects & meshes (purge) after
created joined mesh
Hmmm... not sure what I mean. Reading this after writing.

remove camera when removing bake scene

add custom property to images that says they are a bake image and 
what collection they belong to

set_up_displacement_for_baking_by_material
make checks to see if input node is of type displacement
or vector displacement on row 996

Possibly huge time saver to join all high poly meshes before baking
see object_manager.join_high_poly_objects

bake preview materials don't seem to update when a new texture is baked

image has correct size even when baking one object at a different resolution

addon works now

Remove various print statements

remove printSomething.py

Add panic button for repositioning all object to orig locations (explosion)

joining highres objects of ca 3 million takes 30 sec to render
Make some limit on which objects to join

add video links

when just baking one object and it does not have high res, blender locks

there is a crash sometimes at line 29 in delete scene. Perhaps do some printing and 
see if I can replicate

when previewing bake textures (eye button). add material to objects in 
bake collection if they don't have materials

Bake pass names are weird when they are created. check on_bake_type_update

AOV as bake pass

set up normalize for pointiness in shader

preview material - add disp

------
Notes from session w Arvid

picker för high poly - ok

colors in uI

Bugg med repro. Testa köra bake selected på saker som är gömda med ögat - ok

Eller om man trycker bake i edit mode är också unhandled - ok

En till bug found. Om man trycker bake på något utan en high poly länkad på sig, t.ex. för AO bake grejen så dör det också - ok

--------

Notes från session med gustav

 - borde stå att det är lowpoly i create 

- Bake type borde vara större och en enda rad - ok

- Base color eller normal som default - ok

- Det blev nån skum bugg när man bakat diffuse och sen bytte passet till base color
-Det är i compositorn som det är linear per default

- resolution > 128 as default - ok

- Göra preset - ok
////////////////////////////
linked high polys in list instead?
https://sinestesia.co/blog/tutorials/using-uilists-in-blender/

make better baking grid (multi row and columns)

material id does not work correctly with multiple objects

finish code for fixing skew normals. I have written
set_up_modifers_for_skew_normals in object manager
finish fix_skew_normals

add alpha to channel transfer

write procedure for allowing cleanup or turn it off. This is easier for debugging

bug when not joining high poly objects. crash!

perhaps turn off skew angle fix by default?

create operator for deleting bake scenes

images does not bake after implementing vertex color

vertex bake don't work first try when no vertex color exists
yet

preview with eye for vertex colors

working on get_parent_collections_by_object
check that all collections are collected

vertex color bake stopped working
remove ui stuff when baking vertex colors
add thickness pass. Use ao with inner and "only local"

transfer vertex color - coordinates are off, since the duplicated
objects are merged. Perhaps I can duplicate them before joining 
and use as transfer buffer?


change explosion so it does not move the object if bounding box
is off centre. Instead, just increase spacing

Add image to current material in shader editor


Invert options for all channels in transfer channel bake pass

Margin override on all bake passes (mostly for opacity)





think about how to solve the issue of materials using 
"generated" as texture coordinate

----------
started working on  OBJECT_OT_popupwin_promp_yes_no(bpy.types.Operator):


Vid check eller innan bake

kolla alla material på objekt som är bake source


innehåller materialet en input node med generated inkopplat?


Tell user: join will happen due to optimization. 

Ask user: do you want to normalize scale on texture space?

if yes: normalize texture space scale



-----------------------

Option for join objects or not. 
---------------------------


strange crash when baking a bake pass, change image format and rebake

Add packing uv space parameters

sometimes crashes on settings_manager.py", line 321 in set_settings


bigger distance on explode grid when baking ao?


fix normal skewing
perhaps add subdivision option to solve skewed normals when baking

refactor TODO:
- When using operators - use context override as much as possible
- move debug functions to debug module
- move image functions to image module
- try to bundle up functions in long functions 
- use explicit arguments/parameters in functions 
(instead of bake_render_settings when possible for instance)
- Move some functions to more suitable modules. image_manager etc


perhaps create preview material via bake collections?


set more samples auto when normal map uses bevel normal node. Nah. 1 sample seems ok in the normal pass samples
perhaps force bevel node samples up as well? at least temporarily. Yes. 4 samples on bevel nodes is pretty low quality


To think about:
Perhaps use hook to explode?
The issue is high poly sculpted objects (heavy/slow). Can this be solved?


Test array + curve deformed object bake. This crashed earlier... or locked blender
One object (sandals) was locking the baking. Why?? Curves??


pack with uv packmaster if activated






Must be ok to bake with curves etc. Perhaps make a "is bakable"?
Check that this will work all the way with different baking scenarios

rename object from high res object


optimize baking speed by investigating tile size






extra pass: ID (must use temp vertex color). Why vertex id? It should work with random per island, right?
- create vertex color from material index
material ID
object ID
