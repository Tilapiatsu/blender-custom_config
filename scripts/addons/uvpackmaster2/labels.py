Use the 'Iterative' method only in rare cases when you cannot get good margin results with the 'Adjustemt Time' method, despite setting longer adjustment times.

A lower value means the packer will strive less to achieve compact grouping, at the same time it will prioritize achieving better coverage of the overall packing. With a greater value of the parameter, groups will be packed more compactly, but the coverage of the entire solution might be worse.
