If you want to use the UVPackmaster engine together with Blender follow the steps:


1. If you are upgrading from an older add-on version go to Blender preferences and uninstall the previous version of the UVPackmaster add-on. After uninstalling it is recommended to restart Blender.

2. Download the latest version of the UVPackmaster add-on for Blender (2.79 or 2.80 variant) from http://bit.ly/uvp2-downloads (note the add-on zip file names end with 'blend-2.79' and 'blend-2.80').

3. Install the add-on using the standard procedure for Blender add-ons.

4. Download an UVP engine package from gumroad. Note that the engine is required to use the add-on packing features in Blender. If you didn't buy the product you can always use the free demo version available at http://bit.ly/uvp2-downloads. The name of the engine package follows a pattern: uvp-{EDITION}-{VERSION}.zip. Make sure you use the correct engine version. You can use any engine edition, but it will determine a set of packing features which will be available.

5. Extract the engine package at any location convenient for you.

6. At the top of the UVPackmaster add-on interface in Blender press the 'Select UVP Engine' button (a small button next to the engine path field). A file browser will pop up.

7. In the file browser navigate to the path where you extraced the engine package and localize a file named 'release-{VERSION}.uvpini' - select the file in the browser.

8. The engine will be automatically initialized and you can immediatelly start using UVP packing features in Blender.

9. In order to make sure the new engine path will be preserved after Blender is closed go to the Blender Preferences window and click 'Save Preferences'.
